# Android-Challenge

The idea is to write a simple Android native image searcher app, displaying images on a list and allowing the user to download and save them to the gallery.

I propose to use https://unsplash.com/ which hosts very nice images.
API documentation here: https://unsplash.com/documentation.

The idea is to display both the images and some information about them like a title, description and the name of the person or user that uploaded it.
You then have to be able to save as many images as you'd like to the phone's storage.

Example use case:

Open the app, you have a search bar where you can tap your search query, you type "Rabbit", you see many images you like on a list along with title, description and name/username of the uploader. You choose to download the second and third image from that list, those get saved (eg: https://unsplash.com/search/photos/rabbit).

I leave all User Experience and Interface design to your discretion. Of course the more you adhere to standard mobile app UI/UX practices, the better.

Please use only standard android SDK but no external libraries.
